### Presentation slide deck

The slide deck features a 37 slide deck with no restrictions on use. Each slide contains notes to help you understand the point for each slide.

The slide deck is in PPTX format. **The animations will work best when running locally in PowerPoint**.

### Presentation director's cut (Coming soon)

The director's cut is a video walking through the slides in an actual presentation format. It includes commentary throughout to make it easier for you to give this presentation on your own after watching the video.

### Presentation demos (Coming soon)

The demos used in the presentation are offered in the 4 formats: 

1. Angular
1. React
1. Vue
1. Svelte

Each is documented and all implement the same application. Select the demo that works best for your audience.
